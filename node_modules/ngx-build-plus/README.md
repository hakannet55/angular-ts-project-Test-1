# ngx-build-plus

Extend the Angular CLI's default build behavior without ejecting:

- 📄 Extend the default behavior by providing a **partial** config that just contains your additional settings
- 📄 Alternative: Extend the default behavior by providing a custom function
- 📦 Optional: Build a single bundle (e. g. for Angular Elements)
- ☑️ Inherits from the default builder, hence you have the same options
- 🍰 Simple to use 
- ⏏️ No eject needed

## Get the right version

- Angular 6-7/ CLI 6-7: ngx-build-plus@^7
- Angular 8/ CLI 8: ngx-build-plus^8.0.0

## Updating to Version 8

```
ng update ngx-build-plus --force
```

## Breaking Change in Version 7

- The switch ``single-bundle`` now defaults to ``false`` to align with the CLI's default behavior.

## Example

https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus

## Getting started

This shows a minimal example for getting started. It uses a minimal partial webpack configuration that is merged into the CLI's one. Representative for all possible custom webpack configurations, the used one just leverages the ``DefinePlugin`` to create a global ``VERSION`` constant during the build.

Please find the example shown here in the sample application in the folder ``projects/getting-started``.

1. Create a new Angular project with the CLI
2. Add ngx-build-plus: ``ng add ngx-build-plus``
   
   **Note:** If you want to add it to specific sub project in your ``projects`` folder, use the ``--project`` switch to point to it: ``ng add ngx-build-plus --project getting-started``
  
   **Remark:** This step installs the package via npm and updates your angular.json so that your project uses custom builders for ``ng serve`` and ``ng build``.
   
3. Add a file ``webpack.partial.js`` to the root of your (sub-)project:

    ```javascript
    const webpack = require('webpack');

    module.exports = {
        plugins: [
            new webpack.DefinePlugin({
                "VERSION": JSON.stringify("4711")
            })
        ]
    }
    ```
4. Use the global variable VERSION in your ``app.component.ts``:

    ```typescript
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';

    declare const VERSION: string;

    @Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    templateUrl: './app.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
    })
    export class AppComponent {
    title = 'Version: ' + VERSION;
    }
    ```

5. Start your application with the ``--extra-webpack-config`` switch pointing to your partial webpack config:

    ```
    ng serve --extra-webpack-config webpack.partial.js -o
    ```

    If your project is a CLI based sub project, use the ``--project`` switch too:

    ```
    ng serve --project getting-started -o --extra-webpack-config webpack.partial.js
    ```

    **Hint**: Consider creating a npm script for this command.

6. Make sure that the VERSION provided by your webpack config is displayed.

## ngx-build-plus and Angular Elements

While ``ngx-build-plus`` can be used in every Angular configuration, it also comes with some schematics automating some scenarios for Angular Elements. More information about can be found [here](https://www.softwarearchitekt.at/post/2019/01/27/building-angular-elements-with-the-cli.aspx).

## Using Plugins

Plugins allow you to provide some custom code that modifies your webpack configuration. In addition to that, they also provide a pre- and a post-hook for tasks that need to take happen before and after bundling. This is an example for an plugin:

```typescript
export default {
    pre(options) {
        console.debug('pre');
    },
    config(cfg) {
        console.debug('config');
        return cfg;
    },
    post(options) {
        console.debug('post');
    }
}
```

As this plugin is written with TypeScript you need to compile it.

The ``config`` method works like a ``configHook`` (see above).

To use a plugin, point to it's JavaScript representation (not the TypeScript file) using the ``--plugin`` switch:

```
ng build --plugin ~dist\out-tsc\hook\plugin
```

The prefix ``~`` points to the current directory. Without this prefix, ngx-build-plus assumes that the plugin is an installed ``node_module``.

## Using different merging strategies

You can also use plugins to implement different merging strategies. The following plugin demonstrates this:

```javascript
var merge = require('webpack-merge');
var webpack = require('webpack');

exports.default = {
    config: function(cfg) {
        const strategy = merge.strategy({
            'plugins': 'prepend'
        });

        return strategy (cfg, {
            plugins: [
                new webpack.DefinePlugin({
                    "VERSION": JSON.stringify("4711")
                })
            ]
        });
    }
}
```
To execute this, use the following command:

```
ng build --plugin ~my-plugin.js
```

One more time, the ``~`` tells ngx-build-plus that the plugin is not an installed node_module but a local file.

## Advanced example: Externals and Angular Elements

This shows another example for using ``ngx-build-plus``. It uses a custom webpack configuration to define some dependencies of an Angular Element as external which can be loaded separately into the browser and shared among several bundles.

*If you are not interested into this very use case, skip this section.*

The result of this description can be found in the [repository's](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus) ``sample`` directory.

1. Create a new Angular CLI based project and install ``@angular/elements`` as well as ``@webcomponents/custom-elements`` which provides needed polyfills:

    ```
    ng add @angular/elements 
    npm install @webcomponents/custom-elements --save
    ```

2. Expose a component as an Custom Element:

    ```TypeScript
    import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
    import { NgModule, Injector } from '@angular/core';
    import { createCustomElement } from '@angular/elements';

    import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

    @NgModule({
        imports: [
            BrowserModule
        ],
        declarations: [
            AppComponent
        ],
        providers: [],
        bootstrap: [],
        entryComponents:[AppComponent]
    })
    export class AppModule { 

        constructor(private injector: Injector) {
        }

        ngDoBootstrap() {
            const elm = createCustomElement(AppComponent, { injector: this.injector });
            customElements.define('custom-element', elm);
        }

    }
    ```
3. Install ``ngx-build-plus``:

    When using Angular >= 7 and CLI >= 7, you can simply use ``ng add`` for installing ``ngx-build-plus``:

    ```
    ng add ngx-build-plus 
    ```

    If you are using a monorepo, mention the project you want to install ngx-build-plus for:

    ```
    ng add ngx-build-plus --project myProject
    ```

4. **Alternative**: *If, and only if,* this does not work for you, e. g. because you use an earlier Angular version, you can install the library manually:

    ```
    npm install ngx-build-plus --save-dev
    ```

    After this, update your angular.json:

    ```json
    [...]
    "architect": {
        "build": {
            "builder": "ngx-build-plus:build",
            [...]
        }
    }
    [...]
    ```

5. Create a file ``webpack.extra.js`` with a partial webpack config that tells webpack to exclude packages like ``@angular/core``:

    ```JavaScript
    module.exports = {
        "externals": {
            "rxjs": "rxjs",
            "@angular/core": "ng.core",
            "@angular/common": "ng.common",
            "@angular/platform-browser": "ng.platformBrowser",
            "@angular/elements": "ng.elements"
        }
    }
    ```

6. Build your application:

    ```
    ng build --prod --extraWebpackConfig webpack.extra.js --output-hashing none --single-bundle true
    ```

7. You will see that just one bundle (besides the ``script.js`` that could also be shared) is built. The size of the ``main.js`` tells you, that the mentioned packages have been excluded.

    ![Result](result.png)

8. Copy the bundle into a project that references the UMD versions of all external libraries and your ``main.ts``. You can find such a project with all the necessary script files in the ``deploy`` folder of the sample.

    ```html
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>ElementsLoading</title>
    <base href="/">

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">
    </head>
    <body>

    <!-- Consider putting the following UMD (!) bundles -->
    <!-- into a big one -->

    <!-- core-js for legacy browsers -->
    <script src="./assets/core-js/core.js"></script>

    <!-- Zone.js -->
    <!-- 
        Consider excluding zone.js when creating
        custom Elements by using the noop zone.
    -->
    <script src="./assets/zone.js/zone.js"></script>


    <!-- Polyfills for Browsers supporting 
            Custom Elements. Needed b/c we downlevel
            to ES5. See: @webcomponents/custom-elements
    -->
    <script src="./assets/custom-elements/src/native-shim.js"></script>

    <!-- Polyfills for Browsers not supporting
            Custom Elements. See: @webcomponents/custom-elements
    -->
    <script src="./assets/custom-elements/custom-elements.min.js"></script>


    <!-- Rx -->
    <script src="./assets/rxjs/rxjs.umd.js"></script>

    <!-- Angular Packages -->
    <script src="./assets/core/bundles/core.umd.js"></script>
    <script src="./assets/common/bundles/common.umd.js"></script>
    <script src="./assets/platform-browser/bundles/platform-browser.umd.js"></script>
    <script src="./assets/elements/bundles/elements.umd.js"></script>

    <!-- Calling Custom Element -->
    <custom-element></custom-element>

    </body>
    </html>
    ```

9. Test your solution.

**Hint:** For production, consider using the minified versions of those bundles. They can be found in the ``node_modules`` folder after npm installing them.

**Hint:** The sample project contains a node script ``copy-bundles.js`` that copies the needed UMD bundles from the ``node_modules`` folder into the assets folder.
